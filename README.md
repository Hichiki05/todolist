# DoNow - Simple To-Do List & Task Management Web App

**DoNow** is a minimalist and user-friendly web application designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. The app features a task input area, a dynamic to-do list with options to mark tasks as complete or delete them, and a simple image slider for added aesthetic appeal. With a clean, pastel-themed design, DoNow provides a calming interface for managing your workflow.

## Features
